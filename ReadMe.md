# BitTorrent Python Code with gRPC Protocol

This repository contains Python code for implementing a BitTorrent client and server using the gRPC protocol. The code consists of `client.py`, `server.py`, and related protocol buffer files (`bittorrent.proto`, `bittorrent_pb2.py`, `bittorrent_pb2_grpc.py`).

## BitTorrent Protocol Overview

**BitTorrent** is a peer-to-peer file sharing protocol used for distributing large amounts of data over the Internet. Unlike traditional client-server models, BitTorrent distributes the load across multiple hosts (peers) by breaking files into smaller chunks. Each peer can both download and upload chunks simultaneously, facilitating faster and more efficient distribution.

### Key Features:
- **Decentralized**: BitTorrent operates without a central server, allowing peers to connect directly to each other for file sharing.
- **Resilient**: The protocol is resilient to failures as it doesn't rely on a single point of failure. If one peer goes offline, others can continue sharing.
- **Efficient**: By sharing upload bandwidth among peers, BitTorrent optimizes file distribution and reduces the burden on any single host.

### Uses of BitTorrent:
- **File Distribution**: BitTorrent is commonly used for distributing large files such as software, games, movies, and media content.
- **Open Source Software Distribution**: Many open-source projects leverage BitTorrent to distribute software releases and updates efficiently.
- **Legal Content Distribution**: While BitTorrent has been associated with piracy due to its decentralized nature, it's also used for legal distribution of content, including public domain materials, free software, and Creative Commons-licensed works.
- **Data Backup and Sync**: BitTorrent can be used for distributed backup and synchronization of data across multiple devices or servers.

## Code Structure

### `client.py`

The `client.py` file implements the BitTorrent client. It uses gRPC to communicate with the server and download a file.

#### Functions:
- **`download_file(stub)`**: Downloads a file from the server by requesting file metadata and chunks iteratively.
- **`run_bittorrent_client()`**: Sets up a gRPC channel and initiates file download.

### `server.py`

The `server.py` file implements the BitTorrent server. It serves file metadata and chunks to clients upon request.

#### `BitTorrentServicer` Class:
- **`RequestFileMetadata(request, context)`**: Returns metadata of the requested file (e.g., filename and size).
- **`RequestFileChunk(request, context)`**: Returns a specific chunk of the file based on the client's request.
- **`UploadFileChunk(request, context)`**: Receives file chunks uploaded by clients (not implemented in the provided code).

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_directory>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies** (Assuming gRPC and necessary libraries are installed):
   ```bash
   pip install grpcio grpcio-tools
   ```

3. **Run the Server**:
   ```bash
   python server.py
   ```

4. **Run the Client** (In a separate terminal or machine):
   ```bash
   python client.py
   ```

5. **Observe Output**:
   - The client will download the file specified by the server.
   - Check the downloaded file in the client's directory.

## Additional Notes
- Make sure the server is running before starting the client.
- Customize the file data and metadata in the `BitTorrentServicer` class according to your requirements.
- Handle exceptions and error cases for robustness in real-world scenarios.
